# Here We can Keep a Simple list ToDo




Exception:
* Add default constructor to exception classes
* xxxEdgeColorException, change input parameter for constructor from vector of FaceSide to FaceletPosition
* modify num of color check: center, edge, corner col in one exception
* make the exception more explicit and descriptive as such center Color,
edge Color, corner Color count in NumOfColorException


Next:
* implement algobase
    * [done] Maintain a datasructure which will return object ( may be pointer or similar )
    which will identify a Cubelet uniquely and this won't be invalidated when
    Cube undergoes multiple operations
    * [done] Add more test cases for above points
    * implement primitve movements to solve single face
        * add method get relative FaceSide and Position
    * Add check for is_mid in roate implementation
    * Reduce the number of implementation of rotation functions by using Step
    * Add relative position based 'sequence finding'


Generic:
    * add generic interface for collection of elements/objects of a particular type
    * uniqueness of collections to be defined by certain rules
    * each unique element be assigned one unique number between [0  max_no_elements-1], both endpoints inclusive
    * This unique integer associated can be used as an index

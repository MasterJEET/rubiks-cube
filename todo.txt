# Here We can Keep a Simple list ToDo




Exception:
* Add default constructor to exception classes
* xxxEdgeColorException, change input parameter for constructor from vector of FaceSide to FaceletPosition
* modify num of color check: center, edge, corner col in one exception
* make the exception more explicit and descriptive as such center Color,
edge Color, corner Color count in NumOfColorException


Next:
* implement algobase
    * Maintain a datasructure which will return object ( may be pointer or similar )
    which will identify a Cubelet uniquely and this won't be invalidated when
    Cube undergoes multiple operations

* [done] use are/anyOppColor in _init_ method
* [done] in default constructor Cube(), initialize Cube with solved
configuration ( i.e. all 9 of each Color in one Face )
